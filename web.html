                        <h1><fontface="Open Sans"size="5">MAHATMA GANDHI</fontface></h1>
                        <font size="3">The youngest son of the Hindu Gujarati Family, Mohandas Karam Chand Gandhi, was born on 2nd October 1869 in the town "Kathiawar Peninsula" in the small state of Porbandar (now in Gujarat). He was the son of Porbandar's Deewan (Chief Minister) Karam Chand Uttam Chand Gandhi. Karam Chand married four 4 times, and her last wife, Putlibai, was the mother of Mahatma Gandhi. His mother and Father have 3 more children (a daughter and 2 sons except him). Also, there were two daughters from his Father and his previous wives. Karam Chand was a great Chief Minister and was loved by his people. Mohandas was a restless child who was a little naughty but inspired by the stories such as "Harish Chandra" and "Shravan Kumar", which made him too inspired by loyalty, truth, and love. His entire life, he followed these values and lived a simple life.

                            In 1874 his Father shifted to Rajkot on the basis of the security of Deewan, and in 1876, he became the deewan of Rajkot and called his family there. In Rajkot, Mahatma Gandhi went to school at the age of 9, the school was near his home and as he was interested in studies, his Father put him in "Alfred High School" at the age of 11, but he was an average student who didn't much speak and wasn't interested in sports much. Books were his friend, and companions were school lessons.
                            
                            
                            Remembering his marriage at the age of 13 to a young 14-year-old bride Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadiya (popular Kasturba where "ba" is used for mother), he told once that those days marriage was just all about new clothes, sweets, and playing with the relatives because of no information about marriage. Because of this marriage, he had to leave his school for a year but later joined his school back. Still, according to the rituals at those times, the bride was mostly at her parents' home and didn't stay with her husband, who bought many lusty thoughts in his head, and he regrets his thoughts later in his writings.

                        <font size="3">Sardar Patel was born Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel in 1875, at Nadiad, Gujarat, British India, in a middle-class agricultural family of Lewa Patidar community. There is no official record of his date of birth, but October 31 is mentioned as his date of birth on his matriculation exam papers. He was the fourth of six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and his wife, Laadbai. His father had participated in the 1857 Mutiny, in the army of Rani Laxmi of Jhansi.

                            Growing up in a traditional Hindu family, his early childhood was spent on family’s agricultural fields at Karamsad. By late teens, he completed his middle school education at Karamsad. In 1891, he was married to Jhaverba when he was 16. At 22, he completed his matriculation from a high school in Nadiad/Petlad in 1897.
                            
                            Patel aimed to work and collect necessary money to go to England to study law. After schooling, he studied by borrowing law books and passed the District Pleader’s examination. In 1900, he started his law practice at Godhra. He brought his wife, Jhaverba, from her parent’s place, and together, they set up a home. They had two children: a daughter, Maniben (B.1904), and a son, Dahyabhai (b.1906).
                            
                            With his hard work and dedication, Patel became a capable lawyer. During a plague epidemic, he contracted the disease while nursing a friend. Leaving his family, he went to Nadiad to recuperate.

After her husband, the Maharaja of Jhansi Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, passed away, Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to recognize the Maharaja’s adopted son as his heir and seized Jhansi in accordance with their “doctrine of lapse” policy.</font>
